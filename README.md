This is my first practical assignment in lectures, this assignment is done in groups. Here I am in groups with 2 of my friends. This assignment is a task of creating a simple data input website which consists of several parts including a home page that contains the names of group members, a login page that contains a page for logging in and registering accounts, then an input page that contains columns to enter the data you want to enter, and finally there is a page to preview what you want to print and print it. For the login, register and data input database here we use XAMPP as software to have a local server.
